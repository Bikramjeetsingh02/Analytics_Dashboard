# Analytics_Dashboard
Python, Spark and API Based project to show Analytics performed on an E-Commerce platform

1. Data Collection: The first step is to collect the data from the e-commerce platform. This data can include customer data, transaction data, product data, and other relevant information. The data can be stored in a data warehouse or a Spark cluster for further processing.

2. Data Processing: Once the data is collected, it needs to be processed to extract insights and generate reports. Spark can be used to process large volumes of data quickly and efficiently. Python can be used to build data processing pipelines using Spark APIs like PySpark.

3. Data Visualisation: The processed data can be visualised using a React-based dashboard. The dashboard can display various charts, tables, and graphs to give insights into the data. React charting libraries like s, Victory, or D3 can be used to build charts and graphs.

4. Rest API: A Rest API can be built using Python Flask to serve the processed data to the React dashboard. The API can fetch the data from the Spark cluster and serve it in a format that can be consumed by the dashboard.

5. Dashboard Design: Finally, the dashboard can be designed using React components. The dashboard can be designed to be interactive, allowing users to explore the data and filter it based on various criteria.

Deployment: The final step is to deploy the dashboard and API to a server. Platforms like AWS or Heroku can be used to deploy the dashboard and API.
